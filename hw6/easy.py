# 1. Given an array of integers, write a function to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

# Time Complexity:
# This has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
# We are iterating over the array and summing up each element, but this is still not the most Pythonic way.

# Optimized sum of array
def sum_of_array_optimized(arr):
    return sum(arr)

# Time Complexity:
# The time complexity remains O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
# Pythonâ€™s built-in sum function is implemented in C, making it more efficient in terms of execution time, even though the Big-O is the same.
